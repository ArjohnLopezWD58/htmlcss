            <td><p>Anna Karenina tells of the doomed love affair 
                between the sensuous and rebellious Anna and the 
                dashing officer, Count Vronsky. Tragedy unfolds 
                as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and must endure 
                the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and 
                richly textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, 
                the novel's seven major characters create a dynamic 
                imbalance, playing out the contrasts of city and 
                country life and all the variations on love 
                and family happiness.</p>

            <td><p>For daring to peer into the heart of an adulteress and enumerate 
                its contents with profound dispassion, the author of Madame Bovary 
                was tried for "offenses against morality and religion." What shocks 
                us today about Flaubert's devastatingly realized tale of a young 
                woman destroyed by the reckless pursuit of her romantic dreams is 
                its pure artistry: the poise of its narrative structure, the opulence 
                of its prose (marvelously captured in the English translation of 
                Francis Steegmuller), and its creation of a world whose minor 
                figures are as vital as its doomed heroine.</p>
